# Scorekeeper and Phase Compan10n

Two local-first scorekeeping experiences share saved Players and UI primitives,
without sharing scoring rules. Scorekeeper supports Points, Single Round Winner,
and Pass/Fail. Points optionally uses an independently directed numeric Tiebreaker.
Phase Compan10n retains Phase 10 scoring and automatic completion, and also supports
Early Finish.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run build
```

React Compiler is enabled. Submitted forms use TanStack Form; the data flow is
Routes -> Components -> TanStack Query -> domain API -> IndexedDB. Query keys
separate the Scorekeepers, while Player mutations invalidate dependent views in
both. Totals, Standings, graphs, and result snapshots are derived in the API layer.

## Navigation and presentation

The client-only SPA uses hash routes beneath the configured GitHub Pages base
(`/scorekeeper/`). Home at `/` always shows the Scorekeepers chooser, without a
back arrow. The generic Scorekeeper Dashboard lives at `/scorekeeper`, with
`/scorekeeper/create`, `/scorekeeper/players`, `/scorekeeper/games`, and
`/scorekeeper/game/$gameId` beneath it. Phase Compan10n pages remain under
`/phaseCompan10n`. Old top-level generic routes and `/scorekeepers` are removed
without redirects. Game detail and mutation APIs reject the wrong Scorekeeper's
records.

Both dashboards put **Home** first in their menus to return to the shared chooser.
Pause, setup Cancel, and back arrows within a Scorekeeper return to its dashboard.
Both Scorekeeper Dashboards show only Active Games; each Games page includes that
Scorekeeper's Active and retained Completed Games. Saved Player names, colors, and favorites
are shared. Generic pages have straight-edged surfaces; Phase pages retain their
logo, slants, and specialized controls.

The [shared presentation contracts](docs/shared-presentation.md) describe shell
and Player identity boundaries. [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) defines domain vocabulary.
Phases Card sharing remains self-contained at the
[nested hash routes](docs/adr/0001-self-contained-phases-card-share-urls.md).

## Tests

`npm test` runs Vitest behavior tests, including rendered safe-area layout tests
using Playwright WebKit. After installing npm dependencies, install that browser:

```bash
npx playwright install webkit
npm test
```

On Linux CI, use `npx playwright install --with-deps webkit` instead. The browser
tests start and close their own local Vite server; no running app is required.
Device insets are supplied through the shared `--safe-area-inset-*` CSS variables
because desktop WebKit automation does not expose hardware cutouts or Safari's
mobile toolbar. Real-device checks remain necessary for browser-chrome overlap.

## Scorekeeper persistence

All Scorekeepers share `phase10-db`. Schema version 8 deliberately resets disposable
pre-refactor data, including Players, Games/Rounds, custom Phases/Sets, favorites,
and settings. This runs only when upgrading from a version below 8; ordinary
reloads and future upgrades must preserve the new records.
Keep the reset boundary at `oldVersion < 8`: future schema changes must increment
the database version and add separate, nondestructive upgrade steps, with guarded
store/index creation. Never move the reset boundary to the latest version.

Game/Round records have explicit `scorekeeper` ownership. Shared lifecycle types
live in `src/types/gameLifecycle.ts`; Phase 10 fields remain in the Phase variants.
All generic Round submissions provide an explicit `mode` matching their Game;
there is no implicit Points-mode compatibility fallback.
Completed Games contain `playerSnapshots` (identity/name/color), `winnerIds`, and
`completionType`. Active views use live saved Players; completed views use snapshots.
Normal Phase 10 completion still awards exactly one winner under its existing rules.

Use `withGameTransaction`, `finalizeGame`, and `deleteGameRecords` in
`src/data/api/gameLifecycle.ts` for completion and Game-owned cleanup. Resolve
winners and capture identities inside that transaction, including the finishing
Round write, Early Finish, and per-Scorekeeper retention.
Whole-Game cleanup preserves shared Players, saved catalog data, and temporary
Phases still referenced by another Game or Phase Set.

Active Game writes must validate shared Player references inside the same
transaction as the write (`requirePlayers`/`saveActiveGame`). Player deletion
checks all Active Game references, regardless of Scorekeeper, in a transaction
that also locks Players. There is no archived/hidden Player state.
Normal Phase completion happens through `roundsApi.add`; manual completion uses
`gamesApi.finish` or `genericGamesApi.finish`. Manual completion awards all tied
first-place Players. Every completion requires at least one saved Round and
retains the latest 20 Completed Games for its own Scorekeeper, removing evicted
Games and their owned records atomically. Active Games never expire.

Add Round drafts live only while their scoreboard is mounted. Closing the dialog
retains a draft; saving clears it, and leaving (including Pause) discards it.
Completed scoreboards, Standings, graphs, and Games lists use snapshots even after
saved Players are edited or deleted. No saved-round editing, persistent drafts,
or production prototype/debug controls are exposed.
